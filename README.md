# KGNet
Kotlin Game Network - A kotlin\networking learning project.
This project is for fun and learning, and were made for personal use. It is not proffesional.
A couple of important notes:
1. The Actual KGNet is only 1 file, why the fuck would you do that? so I can easily just drop it in the project files and have a server working in seconds
2. Although it requires you the initalize a the KGNet object, many of the KGNet inner class are static and therefore not allow for more then 1 working server, why? because I'm fucking lazy, and (see above)
